# AwsLambdaTesting_01
AwsLambdaTesting_01 testing lambda functions in AWS.

to make this work, git clone git@github.com:balihoo-krice/AwsLambdaTesting_01.git
cd to AwsLambdaTesting_01
then pyenv local 3.6.1  so you get a non-blambda python in this directory
then pip install awscli

Next, need to configure AWS CLI to work with your keys.
